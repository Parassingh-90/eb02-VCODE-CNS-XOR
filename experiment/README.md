### Aim<br>
Student must be able to understand the concept of XOR operation used in cryptography.<br>
### Theory<br>
<div align="justify">
XOR cipher employs the XOR logical operation in order to encrypt data. The most common component in order to generate complex ciphers XOR operator is extremely used. XOR operation uses the same key for both encryption and decryption. First, either a random key is generated or choosen. Then, XOR operation is performed using the key so that an encrypted data is created. In order to decrypt, the same key should be used and XOR operation should be run again. That is why it is known as a symmetric encryption.
The advantage of XOR operator is that it is simple to implement, and that the XOR operation is computationally inexpensive. That is why XOR is used inside most encryption algorithms or used with various other encryption methods. A simple repeating XOR (means the same key is used for xor operation on the whole data) cipher is therefore sometimes used for hiding information in cases where no particular security is required. To make reverse engineering in case of computer malware more difficult XOR cipher is often used. In XOR cipher operation when random key size is as long as the message itself, it is impossible to crack it. In other words, it can be said it offers a very high level of security.<br></div>

### Procedure<br>
1)User has to provide an alphabetical string which user wants to encrypt.<br>
2)Click on Next and choose an encryption key from the list.<br>
3)Click on Encrypt and the Cipher text will be generated.<br>
4)User has to provide the generated Cipher text and choose a decryption key from the list.<br>
5)Click on Decrypt and the decrypted text will be generated and matched with the original text provided by the user at start.<br>
