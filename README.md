<b> Lab | <b> Cryptography & Network Security
<b> Experiment|     <b> 1.Write a C program that contains a string (char pointer) with a value \Hello Worldâ€™. The program should XOR each character in this string with 0 and displays the result.

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

The objective of this lab is that student must able to know about XOR operation used in cryptography to secure message.

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
<div align="justify">
XOR Encryption is an encryption method used to encrypt data and is hard to crack by brute-force method, i.e generating random encryption keys to match with the correct one.In this experiment user XOR given string each character with key 0 as default and display result as ciphertext.</div>
