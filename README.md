<b> Experiment|     <b> 1.Write a C program that contains a string (char pointer) with a value \Hello Worldâ€™. The program should XOR each character in this string with 0 and displays the result.

<h5> About the Lab (Objective) : </h5>

This Lab is all about the Cryptography and Network Security Lab

<h5> About the Experiment : </h5>
<div align="justify">
In this experiment XOR operation is used to perform encryption and decryption process.In this experiment user perform XOR on given string each character with key 0 as default and display result as ciphertext.Different keys are also available to perform encryption and decryption process on given string.Same key is used for both encryption and decryption process to generate ciphertext and plaintext using ASCII code of a character.</div>
