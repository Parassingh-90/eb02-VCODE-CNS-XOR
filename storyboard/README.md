## Storyboard (Round 2)

Experiment 1: Write a C program that xor each character in a string with 0-9 and displays the result.

### 1. Story Outline:

In cryptography, the simple XOR cipher is a type of additive cipher. The concept of implementation is to first define XOR – encryption key and then to perform XOR operation of the characters in the String with this key which we want to encrypt. In order to get the original String, we need to decrypt each characters. To decrypt the encrypted characters we have to perform XOR operation again with the defined key.

### 2. Story:

Describe the Story intorduction here (guide : The next step is to write a story. Story should be a brief logical description in simple English. It should talk about the overall execution of the experiment in a simplified manner. (should not include any equations/ drawings). The story should include the following points) )

#### 2.1 Set the Visual Stage Description:
Describe here : (guide When a user lands up into a simulator, the visual stage is the first thing that user comes across. The visual stage should include all the elements to be seen by a user on an imaginary canvas.  (This should NOT include any drawings. ) )

#### 2.2 Set User Objectives & Goals:
Describe the objectives and goals in details here : (guide : The user should clearly understand the aims and objective of the experiment. ( how he will begin experiment. ?  in descriptive))

#### 2.3 Set the Pathway Activities:

Describe the pathway activites here : (Guide : Set the pathway activities in line with the learning objectives (LOs)  & with a view to achieve the goals set in round #0 & round#1.  (once he begins, how he will traverse through the entire experiment ? in descriptive))

##### 2.4 Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/Variations in Questions:

Describe the challenges Here : (guide : Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/variations in questions according to User’s level, so as to invoke the learners’ interest.  (while traversing, what challenges he will face? how he has to solve and overcome ? descriptive).)

##### 2.5 Allow pitfalls:

1. The simulator is designed for encrypting only alphabetical string, therefore student must be attentive while providing plain text.<br>
2. Student must be attentive while decrypting the cipher text, as a small change in either cipher text or decryption key will cause an incorrect decrypted text.<br>

##### 2.6 Conclusion:
Describe conclusion here : (guide: This may include displaying: how much time did the user take to solve the questions/ How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be suggested to the user. (once he is towards the completion of the experiment, what LO he is taking along with him, what will be his probable, interpretation/conclusion , descriptive) )

##### 2.7 Equations/formulas: NA
Cipher Text = Plain Text &oplus; Key<br>
Plain Text = Cipher Text &oplus; Key<br>


### 3. Flowchart 4
<img src="flowchart/flowchart.png"/><br>
link to flow chart Here : Store in the  /flowchart folder within Round2 folder in your repo
<br>
(guide :The lab proposer should extract logic from the story, prepare a flowchart from the story narration and write the algorithm to execute the black box.  use Google Drawings https://docs.google.com/drawings/ (send the link to your flowchart and also attach .png by exporting it )

### 4. Mindmap:
<img src="mindmap/mindmap.png"/>
 Link to mindmap here : Store the mindmap in both .mm & .png extension in the  /mindmap folder and include link of only .pdf verison here
 <br>
 (guide : An elaborate mind map (connecting all the points in the experiment flow ) should be prepared and submitted by the lab proposer. The mind map should be a clear and detailed document that takes into account all minute intri5acies involved in the development of virtual lab. The mindmap should be self-content and any developer across the globe should be able to code it with all those details. using only FreeMind http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Main_Page (send the .png file and also the original .mm extension project file. )

### 5. Storyboard :

(guide: This document should include sketching and description scene wise (duration, action, description). Software to be used for storyboarding : https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/ (Its a FOSS tool) . tutorial on how to use it https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LAeCEpG0KX4
