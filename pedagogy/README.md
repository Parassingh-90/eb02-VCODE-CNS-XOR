#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :   Expository 
###### Assessment Method: As per handout

<u> <b>Description: </b> of how you are going to implement the above Instructional Strategy in your Simulator: </u>
<br>
 student have to follow the instruction to perform operation.Provide the input string of length 10 and than select the key value to XOR it.To verify the ciphertext again perform decryption operation.
